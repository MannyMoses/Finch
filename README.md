# Finch marketing analyzer

##User Story

I am an advertiser/marketing analyst that needs an app to help me track how products/company reputation is spreading through social media through Twitter metrics and performance, in order to create optimal ad campaigns.

## Development Strategy

1. Brainstorming sessions on what app the group would like to build.
2. Reading the Twitter API and understanding how it works.
3. Using Material UI for CSS and reading documentation on how to use it in React JS.
4. Build the app folder structure with routes, pages, components and adding package.json on both root and client levels.
5. Back-end created the routes and made it possible to connect teh API. They also created the databases.
6. Front-end created components which were rendered on the pages.
7. Created a login page, a registration page, a dashboard and a saved tweets page.
8. The login page has the emaill address and password fields in order for the user to insert their credentials and login.
9. Registration page, similar to login has fields for the user to register on the app.
10. Once loged in the user with be routed to the Dashboard where they can search keywords on the searchbar and they will receive results with tweets containing that keyword.
11. While browsing on tweets the user can save tweets of their liking.
